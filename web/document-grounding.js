// their own label, and a plain "5" or "27001" or "2015" carries no such
// scope, whether it arrived alone -- "Skills: 2025" -- or split off a shared
// prefix by parseResume's "," / ";" / "|" split -- "Skills: ISO 27001,
// 124141, 2015". Either way, there is nothing left to tell whether it is
// still part of a standard, a separate one, or an unrelated year. Rather
// than guess, every letterless token is dropped, with no exception: "24/7"
// and "100%" are the same digit-plus-symbol shape as "-50", "1-2", and
// "2020-2024", and none of them carry a letter to claim a meaning others
// would have to guess at.
//
// That costs bare part numbers -- 6502, 8051, 68000 -- which are real skills
// on a systems resume and have no letter either. The loss is accepted, not
// overlooked: "8051" and "2025" are the same shape, four bare digits, and
// nothing in the token says which is a part number and which is a year, so
// a filter that goes by shape and keeps one keeps the other. Both are
// dropped. A part number that names itself, "MOS 6502" or "Z80", is kept.
